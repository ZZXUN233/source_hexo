Oh, in the strong wind
There is a beautiful singer
Why she is singing here
Who she is singing for
Maybe the flying leaves know
Maybe the standing bridge knows
Her voice stabbed into the night
Her shadow disappeared in the wind

Yeah, Yeah
I miss her so much
I am always facing the wind
As stronger the wind blowing
As she is getting closer and closer
Suddenly disappeared in the wind
Standing carefully I am the street light
Waitting and waitting and missing her
