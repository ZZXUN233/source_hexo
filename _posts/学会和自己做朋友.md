We are so mean to ourselves, So utterly, barbarically cruel.

If we saw someone treating a stranger the way we tend to treat ourselves, we'd be appalled. We need to learn to be that most rare of things: a proper friend to ourselves.

To be our own best friend! It doesn't come naturally, we need to practice saying some of the following to ourselves:<br/>
You deserve to exist,<br/>
it's OK to make mistakes, <br/>
you can be forgiven. <br/>
I know how hard you try, <br/>
and all the obstacles you've had to overcome, <br/>
I don't care what the others think, <br/>
You can be weak with me. <br/>
You can mess up. <br/>
You can fall apart. <br/>
You can be imperfect. <br/>
You can let me down. <br/>
I'm on your side. <br/>
I'm touched by how much effort you have made and how deeply you have suffered.<br/>
You don't have to prove youself to me. <br/>
I don't need you to 'be' somebody... <br/>
I can love you as you are - despite everything. <br/>
I'm your best friend. Always! <br/>
And I'm right here.
